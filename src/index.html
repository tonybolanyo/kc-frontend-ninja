                        <p>Flexbox, short for “flexible box,” is a layout mode introduced in CSS3
                            that determines how elements are arranged on a page so that they behave
                            predictably under different screen sizes and devices. It is called Flexbox
                            because of its ability to expand and shrink elements inside the the flex
                            box to best fill the available space.</p>

                    <p>Jonathan Z. White</p>
                    <p>Last week, one of my readers sent in a question: How do I become a
                        better visual designer? As I was thinking about how to answer this
                        question, my mind wandered to my experience with learning Mandarin
                        Chinese. Recently, I decided to teach myself Mandarin. When it comes
                        to learning a new language, you first have to start with the
                        fundamentals. Nouns, pronouns, and verbs form the basis for
                        conveying more complex ideas.</p>

                    <p>Is it possible to hit a million requests per second with Python?
                        Probably not until recently. A lot of companies are migrating away
                        from Python and to other programming languages so that they can
                        boost their operation performance and save on server prices, but
                        there’s no need really. Python can be right tool for the job.</p>

                    <p>I’ve consulted on a dozen microservice projects. Some were awesome
                        (this is the future!) and some were equally frustrating (who invented
                        this crap?) It’s the execution that matters, not the approach. You can
                        succeed or fail with either. Don’t just accept the love/hate propaganda
                        out there.</p>
